# Amazin' Amazon Trends

## Introduction
Amazon.com has been making waves for the past decade or so, as they grow from strength to strength. What once started as a small online bookstore, has now become not just America’s largest retailer; it is bigger than most brick and mortar retailers in America put together.

One of the consequences of this amazing growth has been an explosion of data. Every product sold on amazon has metadata than can be analyzed and insights can be gained.


We are right in the middle of America’s great retail period; the holiday season from Thanksgiving until Christmas!  Amazon has said the 2016 holidays were its best-ever shopping season. During the winter holiday season, not only did they sell 50% more items than the previous year, but they also doubled their total sales for 2016 [(Source)](http://fortune.com/2017/01/04/amazon-marketplace-sales/).


We suspect that we will see this sort of incredible growth again this year, and so we decided to delve into the data to see what trends we could find!
